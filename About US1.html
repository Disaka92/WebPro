        The water crisis is real. It’s affecting women, children, families and farmers. Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa are spending hours a day fetching dirty water which leads to illness and disease, robbing entire communities of their futures.
<br><br><br>
Lack of access to safe water and proper sanitation limits education and food production, it harms health and leads to a cycle of poverty.<br><br><br>We want to help our neighbors and we know you do too. When you support The Water Project, you help bring clean water through new wells, rehabbed wells, sand dams, rainwater catchment systems and/or spring protections to schools, medical clinics and villages.
<br><br>
We believe local in-country solutions, through local national leaders, can help end the water crisis one partnership at a time. We can’t wait to bring you into the heart of their stories. </p>

    height: auto;">We   are committed to bringing people together to solve the problem of finding clean water. Whether it's our local teams in the field, the folks back at our headquarters, our donors and fundraisers or the communities we serve, we believe water doesn’t change everything. People do. These relationships are the heart and soul of our work.</p>

    height: auto;">Yes, clean water is foundational and it’s at the foundation of what we do at The Water Project. But how we do it is what’s important. We invest in local teams who provide clean water and unlock potential in the villages where people live. Real, local people changing the expectations of their own neighbors on what a water point should do (provide reliable water).</p>

        That's why we love sharing the awesome reports we receive from the field. They are an invitation to be part of the work and celebrations alongside us. When you support The Water Project, you unlock access to real people, both here at our headquarters and via our work in the field. Every gift is directly connected to a community.</p>

        To ensure that impact lasts, we also believe in monitoring all our projects, new and old, to make sure they are still functioning properly. And we fix what's broken. We believe water flowing today should still be flowing in the future. To see all our projects and their current functionality check out our Project Directory.</p>
